**Overview of the Project:**

Creating a simple calculator using Python is a great project for beginners to practice basic programming concepts like variables, functions, conditionals, and loops. Hereâ€™s an overview of how you can approach this project:

**Step-by-Step Overview:**

- **User Input Handling:**
Prompt the user to enter the first number.
Prompt the user to enter the operation (+, -, *, /).
Prompt the user to enter the second number.

- **Performing Operations:**
Based on the operation chosen (+, -, *, /), perform the corresponding calculation.
Handle edge cases like division by zero if implementing division.

- **Output the Result:**
Display the result of the calculation to the user.

**Detailed Steps:**

- **1. User Input Handling:**
Use input() function to get the numbers and the operation from the user.
Convert the input strings to appropriate data types (e.g., int or float).
- **2. Performing Operations:**
Use if-elif-else statements to check which operation the user wants to perform.
Perform the arithmetic operations based on the user's choice.
- **3. Output the Result:**
Print the result of the operation.

**Enhancements:**
Error handling for non-numeric inputs.
Implementing more complex operations like exponentiation or modulus.
Adding a loop to allow the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

**Conclusion:**
Building a simple calculator in Python is a practical way to reinforce basic programming concepts while creating a useful tool. As you gain confidence, you can expand the functionality and design to suit more advanced requirements or user interfaces.
